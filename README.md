A responsive site with Spotifys latest albums and singles. Built in React.

## The problem

This week was out first project with React, so the challenge was building a site in a diffrent way we are used to. But we managed to grasp it quickly and the site took up relatively quickly to build. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
